# Lindows-Virtual-Machine-Checker
**This is a simple kernel mode driver that prevents people from installing Lindows 11.1 on a physical machine.**

With all signature verifications in Windows now completely removed in Lindows 11.1, this operating system is more likely to be infected by malwares than any other NT based operating systems. So, to protect inexperienced Windows users from being attacked, we've implemented this simple protection logic. 

If the current machine is not a virtual machine, it will immediately trigger a BSOD and prevent the user from reaching the desktop. 

However, that doesn't mean people cannot install Lindows 11.1 on a physical machine. It's actually extremely simple to hack this driver! 

I will not try to stop anyone from hacking this driver or posting tutorials online about how to hack this driver. I do not want to create headaches for people who actually need Lindows 11.1.

For those who can't hack this driver, the odds are that they don't really need to use Lindows 11.1 at all, and for those who need Lindows 11.1 for real, they will be able to find a way to hack this virtual machine detection mechanism very quickly. 

If you can't hack this virtual machine checker module, then I'm really worried about what will happen if I let you use this modded OS on a physical machine. 
Play around with this mod in a virtual machine then! I won't let anyone who is lacking the most basic Windows unbricking skills use Lindows 11.1 on a physical machine! 

Cus what if a noob installed it and bricked their PC then says to me: "Shit OS! A lot less stable than orignal Windows 10. Fuck you Happy_mimimix!"
