Tip: Lindows 11.1 is not yet finished, this document only serves as a preview. Features may be added or removed at any time during the development process, please refer to the final product.

**Please validate the only official download address: https://github.com/happymimimix/Lindows_11.1-Post_Reset/releases**

**Anyone is allowed to make their own customized version of Windows based on Lindows 11.1, but they must clearly indicate in Readme that they are using my work and they must clearly inform the user that the file they are downloading is not the original Lindows 11.1 officially released by Happy_mimimix!**  

##

**NOTICE: Lindows 11.1 only supports legacy booting, any new devices must have legacy emulation enabled in BIOS setup in order to install Lindows 11.1 properly.** 

**Currently, I have no intention of supporting UEFI. Which is not only more difficult to modify, but also less reliable and compatible than Legacy. I did an experiment on the startup speed and obviously UEFI wasn't performing any better than legacy in my test. UEFI boots faster is just a busted myth!**

**If you insist on using UEFI, then I'm sorry that my original implementation of Lindows 11.1 can't meet your needs. You can take a look in [Forks](https://github.com/happymimimix/Lindows_11.1-Post_Reset/forks) to see if any third parties have ported this project to UEFI.**
